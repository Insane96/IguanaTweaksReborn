## 3.8.0 - The Aging animals update

  * The biggest problem with animals is that as long as you have space, you can have infinite of them (especially chickens). With this, you can have infinite but will die eventually
  * After growing from babies, animals will now have a life span, based off the type of animal
  * Cows (and mooshrooms), Chickens, Sheep, Pigs, Rabbits, Quark's Crabs, Autumnity Snails and Turkeys can die of old age
  * Animals have 4 "stages": Young, Adult, Mid age and elder
    * Young animals are considered as such when below 25% of their lifespan. They have normal drops
    * Adult animals are considered as such when between 25%~50% of their lifespan. They have increased drops
    * Mid age animals are considered as such when between 50%~75% of their lifespan. They have normal drops
    * Elder animals are considered as such when above 75% of their lifespan. They have reduced drops and are slowed down
  * If pehkui is installed, animals will also visually grow
* Graves

    * This fixes graves staying in the world even if the owner died, but it's no longer online

  * The high enchantability and the fact that can mine like an Iron Pick makes them too strong 
* Slightly increased Tiredness debuffs (2% -> 2.5%)
* Arrow nerf now works differently
  * You may ask "In which way it works differently?", well, I don't really know, I just know I've reworked the code and used Mixins, since the old way was not behaving properly
  * HOWEVER, I know for sure that arrow's damage is no longer rounded up to the nearest integer, so between arrows and quartz arrows (from ITE) the difference now actually exists
  * The arrow damage nerf is also applied to crossbows now, but crossbows shoot arrows with more velocity
* Reduced treasure fishing loot's level of enchanting (30 -> 25) and can no longer be enchanted with treasure enchantments
